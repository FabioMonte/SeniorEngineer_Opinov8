Legacy Platform Review & Proposed Enhancement

 Some technical limitations of a monolithic architecture are:
    - Hard to scale parts independently making it a less than flexible environment and less future prone in case there's a need to add/decouple features
    - It's harder to maintain in the sense that the frontend and backend are tightly integrated which means a change in one will require changes to the other. This can be time consuming and costly.
